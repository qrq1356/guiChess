# case conflict ex
netbeans git integration is unable to handle case changes in renames with no other change, I didnt notice this till some commits deep. this was fixed with a forced commit from git integration with windows.

# .gitignore?
extensive use of this feature was made because the project directory contains working databases and entire derby DB installations. commiting these change is heavy and a waste as the state of a DB is unimportant during development, example databases will be included later. but for the most part testing will involve using the local DB state, no need to sync as this is session dependent üëç
