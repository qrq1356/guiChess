My submission for PDC/SC Project 2

# DISCALIMER
this repository is for submission to my assignment only. do not bother trying to interact with it. this repository serves as nothing more than a remote branch and will NOT be maintained.

if this is repository is public its because that was the best way to include it with my submission. it is not a sign of any commitment to support or further development.
